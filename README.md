## WIP HTML CV

try it here: [https://mai-gh.github.io/cv/index.html](https://mai-gh.github.io/cv/index.html)


this is mainly an exercise in css!


page uses css to allow printing as one full page
used [https://github.com/lob/examples/blob/master/letters/8.5x11-letter.html](https://github.com/lob/examples/blob/master/letters/8.5x11-letter.html) as my starting point.



page also uses " check box hack " to toggle state. click any where inside the CV!

this was a great reference: [https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/](https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/)





NO JS !!! JUST HTML AND CSS !!
